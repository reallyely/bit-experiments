description: A Counter component.

import { Counter } from './counter';

The counter component provides the UI and functionality to embiggen or shrink a number.

### Component usage

It's necessary to bring your own state management to use this component. The component internally is able to run your
update functions and return you the new count.

```js
const NecessaryWrapperComponent = ({ children }) => {
  const [propCount, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <Counter propCount={propCount} handleChangeCounter={setCount}>
      {children}
    </Counter>
  );
};

<NecessaryWrapperComponent />;
```
